# dagger-visual-graph
Simple tool to generate visual representation of Dagger graph in the application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jraska/dagger-visual-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jraska/dagger-visual-graph)

The implementation is now quite simple, it does not cover everything and is far away from being perfect, 
but it does the job for me at the moment.


## Usage
```
java -jar dagger-visualizer.jar path/to/sources/root
```
